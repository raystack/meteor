Meteor is a plugin driven agent for collecting metadata. Meteor has plugins to source metadata from a variety of data stores, services and message queues.
It also has sink plugins to send metadata to variety of third party APIs and catalog services.

## Key Features

- **No Dependency:** Written in Go. It compiles into a single binary with no external dependency.
- **Extensible:** Plugin system allows new sources and sinks to be easily added.
- **Ecosystem:** Extract metadata for many popular services with a wide number of service plugins.
- **Customizable:** Add your own processors and sinks to suit your many use cases.
- **Runtime:** Meteor can run inside VMs or containers with minimal memory footprint.

## Installation

Install Meteor on macOS, Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and on any machine.

#### Binary (Cross-platform)

Download the appropriate version for your platform from [releases](https://github.com/raystack/meteor/releases) page. Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere.
You don’t need to install it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.
Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your PATH for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

#### Homebrew

```sh
# Install meteor (requires homebrew installed)
$ brew install raystack/tap/meteor

# Upgrade meteor (requires homebrew installed)
$ brew upgrade meteor

# Check for installed meteor version
$ meteor version
```

## Usage

Meteor’s CLI is fully featured but simple to use, even for those who have very limited experience working from the command line. Run `meteor --help` to see list of all available commands and instructions to use.

```sh
# List of commands
$ meteor --help

# Print command reference
$ meteor reference
```

## Running locally

```sh
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/raystack/meteor.git

# Install all the golang dependencies
$ go mod tidy

# Build meteor binary file
$ make build

# Run meteor on a recipe file
$ ./meteor run sample-recipe.yaml

# Run meteor on multiple recipes in a directory
$ ./meteor run directory-path
```

## Running tests

```sh
# Running all unit tests, excluding extractors
$ make test

# Run integration test for any extractor
$ cd plugins/extractors/<name-of-extractor>
$ go test -tags=integration
```
